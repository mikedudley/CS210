Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project is a console-based investment calculator that shows year-end balances and interest earned over N years for two scenarios: investing a lump sum with and without additional monthly deposits. It solves the question on how much of a differnce monthly deposits can make when investing.

What did you do particularly well?
  I separated the logic into helper functions. The loop makes the logic clear and easy to read/maintain. 
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could enhance my code by adding input validation to make sure that the user enters the values in the correct format. I could have also condensed some of the logic because the two reports share much of the same functions.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  One of the harder pieces of code for this project was making sure that the calculations were being done correctly in the loop because I had some mistakes, and it was hard to figure where the calculation was going wrong. I had to figure out what the numbers should be, and then I was able to better pinpoint the issue. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Many basic skills like building modular code is transferable to all future projects because it enchances readability and maintainability. Also, it was good practice to output the values in a tabular format because I want the user to have an easy time when reading the outputs. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using small, concise helper functions to reduce repetitive logic. I broke up the complex logic into smaller chunks to make it more manageable.
